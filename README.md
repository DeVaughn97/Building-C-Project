# Building C++ Project (2022) (Mortgage Class Fix) 
Note: This Project has been updated as previously the Mortgage Class wouldn't correctly display Mortgage Class schedule or display remaining loan correctly which is now fixed.

Fix Development Time: 1 Day
Project Description: This project is was for refining standard C++ Object Oriented Programming skills at the business level with referenced implementation of rare C++ code

Coding Reference: Building Business Applications Using C++: An Introduction to the Object Model by Lucy Garnett (Book)

Process: Essentially I bought this book for coding reference as a way to keep my C++ skills sharp in case I needed it and so intitially when I dove into this project it was strictly for this reason however overtime I realized that the C++ coding references in the book also provided rare coding samples that aren't readily on the market. The Book was originally written in mid90's so implementation also presented an interesting challenge Micrsoft Visual Studio 2010.

Why is the Referenced Implemented Code provided in the respository rare?
In the current times of the world we are now living in a society where great shutdown even for businesses can be a reality regardless of what software business you are in as even in the Game Business a financial system is needed even for technology basics and that's where this coding reference shines as this book provides startup programs references for financial systems can be built upon to create bigger applications

How does this code relate to games?
One of the biggest cases of this code repository is concept as it covers solid C++ Object Oriented Programming building concepts and principles that can be applied to building any software in C++ including games especially if your building C++ software from scratch.

What are some of the biggest concepts covered in this coding reference?
Sharing data members constructors and header files with other classes is one of the biggest concepts of this implemented coding reference. Also this implemented coding reference covers standard hard coding techniques that can help shape how you program in C++ as implementing and modifying this program helped reshaped my coding style.
